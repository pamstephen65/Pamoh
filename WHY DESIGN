I want to be a designer because design to me makes the picture more clear to both the professional and the novist. For every product that is produced the whole process starts with an idea, then conceptualization of the idea, product design based on the concept(s) and finally implementation.
Life cycle of a product is not complete without design. I can go on-and-on.
We often talk about Blueprints and Prototypes, they are all part of design. I believe with a tool like FIGMA, am gona nail UI/UX.
